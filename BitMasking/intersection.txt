    There are 4 Fruits 

        0-> Apple
        1-> Orange
        2-> Banana
        3-> Litchi


    3 people have different different fruit, and we 
    have to find the person having same fruit together
    TC = O(N)

    Person 1 = 2 & 3
    Person 2 = 0, 1 & 2
    Person 3 = 1 & 3


Approach : Took intersection and its complexities is O(N)

Another approach:

    using BitMasking

        Person 1 :  1 1 0 0
        Person 2 :  0 1 1 1
        Person 3 :  1 0 1 0

    giving 1 to that index of fruit that person have
    and apply & operator for intersection.
